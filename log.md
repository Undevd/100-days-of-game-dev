# 100 Days Of Game Development - Log

### Day 1: 27th July 2019

**Today's Progress**:
* Created a 2D game in Unity
* Create a simple player sprite in GIMP
* Created and attached a movement script to the Player object

**Thoughts:** I would like to be able to easily switch out how the player moves rather than having the logic hardcoded into the Update method.

### Day 3: 31st July 2019

**Today's Progress**:
* Started planning out a 2D maze game
* Created a Pacman like movement strategy

**Thoughts:** Git commits are not a great way to showcase progress on game development, I'm going to look into desktop recording tomorrow and upload videos to youtube instead.
